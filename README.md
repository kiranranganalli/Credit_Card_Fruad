# *Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions*


## *Overview*

This project focuses on building a robust and efficient machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time. With the rising threat of online transaction fraud, financial safety has become a critical priority for individuals and organizations. The project leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to tackle the challenges of fraud detection, including high class imbalance and the need for precise prediction.

*Project Goal*

Accurately detect fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.
Build an interpretable and scalable solution for real-time fraud detection.

*Dataset*
Source: Kaggle â€“ Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset 2023

*Description* : Contains anonymized transaction records, with each entry labeled as fraud or non-fraud.

*Key Features:*

Time and Amount: Basic transaction metadata.

PCA-transformed features: Numerical features obtained via dimensionality reduction.

Highly imbalanced dataset (fraud to non-fraud ratio: ~0.0017).

*Project Workflow*

## *Problem Definition:*

Identify the key challenges in detecting fraud from transactional data.

Define success metrics: High recall, balanced precision, and F1-score.

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):*

Analyze class imbalance, transaction patterns, and feature distributions.

Understand correlations and visual trends in the dataset.

*Data Preprocessing:*

Handle missing values and ensure no data loss post-imputation.
Scale transaction amounts for better model performance.
Address class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).

*Model Development:*

Train and evaluate machine learning models:

*Logistic Regression (baseline model).*

Random Forest (handles non-linear relationships and imbalanced data well).
XGBoost (gradient boosting for enhanced accuracy and efficiency).
Evaluate models using metrics like ROC-AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

*Insights and Recommendations:*
Highlight patterns and transaction behaviors commonly associated with fraud.
Provide actionable insights for stakeholders.
